            <h1>1: Global story</h1>
            <p>Smart watches really hit the scene when the first apple watch was released. The reason for this is that
                Apple always has hype behind its product line. They never release anything revolutionary, instead they
                wait for new innovations to become better and then capitalize on the public’s interest. But this has
                changed with their latest release of the apple watch ultra and its body temperature reading
                capabilities, which when pair up with Apples AI, becomes a revolutionary innovation. </p>
        </article>

        <article class="two">
            <h1>2: What problem does this innovation solve?</h1>
            <p>This innovation solves a greater issue that can be found across wearable technology, which is accuracy.
                Apple’s apple watch ultra is the most accurate when it comes to temperature and heart rate readings
                thanks to its software. This new proven accuracy gives the ability for female users to track their
                ovulation cycles more accurately, when compared to other devices. </p>
        </article>

        <article class="three">
            <h1>3: How to use this innovation</h1>
            <p>To use this innovation, you would first need to buy an apple watch ultra, which at 999 euro does not come
                in cheap. If you do have the expendable income to spend on this watch, you would then access the health
                app on your iPhone or watch, click body measurements and click body temperature. There you will find the
                readings. </p>
        </article>

        <article class="four">
            <h1>4: Who is using this innovation</h1>
            <p>The apple watch ultra is mainly targeted towards athletes and elite divers as it’s one of if not the
                first smart watch to also contain a diving computer. Allow to accurately track diving sessions up to 400
                feet. Taking that into account, you wouldn’t find that many people wearing them if it didn’t solve or
                fit a certain purpose especially when it can cost over a thousand euros. </p>
        </article>

        <article class="five">
            <h1>5: What can you expect from the service this company is delivering</h1>
            <p>I can expect Apple to further implement new functionality and accuracy utilizing software to further
                improve its product. When selling such a compact watch filled with sensors, it is truly endless to what
                it can end up doing. When the hardware is present, the only thing that limits it is its software. </p>
        </article>

        <article class="six">
            <h1>6: Future for this innovation</h1>
            <p>I think that the future for this innovation is further accuracy readings all in a smaller form factor.
                More accurate readings would and could prevent/alert users of heart attacks for example or panic
                attacks, high levels of stress. I think that in the future it will not act as a smart watch but more as
                a life coach to help you through the day. </p>
